# Topology Tester

The Topology Tester app allows you to quickly build a dynamic microservice 
topology using this single app. It has integrated Zipkin instrumentation to
allow you to inspect request handling along the various instances as well as
some commands to inject % failures.

Some notes on how to use in Kubernetes and Istio can be found here:
